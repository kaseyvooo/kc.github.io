In this Dataset, I found this to be the most interesting, and valuable at the same time. As someone who has been to New York and has had trouble with public transportation, this could be very useful for someone wanting to become a cab driver there. The dataset provides detailed info like the exact times, destinations, and how much money cab drivers make within specific hours. This is super useful for drivers aiming to get the most out of their shifts. For example, a driver could use this data to figure out when there might be fewer customers around, or to pinpoint where to hang out to catch the most fares during rush hours. What's exciting is imagining the potential of scaling up this data. Right now, it might only cover a few drivers, but what if it included hundreds? That kind of information could be a game changer, helping not just individual drivers make smarter decisions, but possibly improving the efficiency of the city's whole taxi scene.<br />

I chose this book about Forecasting because this type of work/research interests me the most. I briefly learned about time-series forecasting during my undergraduate, and I found it so interesting because this plays such a big role in our everyday lives. For instance, it's used in weather forecasting, which is something we totally don't think about. However, I want to use it for the stock market. This is also known as price forecasting or trend analysis. The stock market is so unpredictable, that I hope someday that understanding these concepts can help me “predict” the stock market in a better way. <br />
